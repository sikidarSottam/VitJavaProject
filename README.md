# Simple Banking System - Java Project

A basic console-based banking application made as a college OOP project.  
It shows how to work with classes, objects, encapsulation, static members and simple money transfer between accounts.

### Overview

This program simulates a very small banking system where:
- Each person has name, date of birth and address
- Every bank account is linked to one person
- You can deposit, withdraw, check balance and transfer money between accounts
- Keeps count of total accounts created

All output is printed directly from the methods (no Scanner input - everything is demonstrated in main).

### Features

- Create Person and BankAccount objects  
- Deposit & Withdraw money with validation  
- Check current balance with owner name  
- Transfer money from one account to another  
- Show total number of accounts created (using static variable)  
- Indian-style names, addresses and account numbers  

### Technologies / Tools Used

- Java SE (version 8 or higher)  
- No external libraries - pure Java  
- Compiled and run with javac & java (or any IDE)  

### How to Run the Project

1. Copy the entire code into a file named `Main.java`  
2. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder  
3. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
5. You will see all transactions and final balances printed in the console.

That's it - no additional setup or dependencies required!

Happy coding!
